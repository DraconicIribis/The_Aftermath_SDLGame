Setup:
All of the bmp files are in the x64 folder, if the game does not work you may have to move them to the main folder instead.

Gameplay:
You will have to manipulate ai movement to solve pathing puzzles. Get the key and get out to move on to the next level.
    
    Enemies all have unique movements and attacking patterns:
    - Golems (spawn in every level) move right or left and can attack right or left. Whenever the player is not horizontal to them, they will attempt to move up or down. If the player is horizontal, they will attempt to move towards the player. Their horizontal attack is delayed.
    - Bombdudes (spawn in level 2) move right or left and attack by blowing up all squares around them. They take two turns to blow up so you have time to escape.
    - Rockmages (spawn in level 3) move diagonally and attack any square directly adjacent or diagonal to them. They will only move when the player is diagonal to them, and will move towards the player.

	Keep in mind enemies may attack through walls, so don't walk into a wall in the enemies attack pattern. Walking into walls also passes forward time, so keep that in mind as well.

    Use these to solve the puzzles and escape. There are multiple solutions to each level so be creative!

Controls:
You can use wasd or arrow keys for movement.
Esc or q will quit out.
